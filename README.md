<H1>Handling Missing Values with NumPy and Pandas</H1>
In this project, we explore various techniques to handle missing values in datasets using NumPy and Pandas. Missing values, often represented as NaN (Not a Number), can significantly impact data analysis and machine learning models. This repository demonstrates practical methods to manage and impute missing data effectively.
<h2>Key Techniques Covered:</h2>
    <h3>1.Detection of Missing Values:</h3>
    
    
  •Using isna() and notna() functions to identify missing values.
  
  •Counting missing values in each column.

  <h3>2.Removing Missing Values:</h3>
  
  •Dropping rows or columns with missing values using dropna().

  <h3>3. Replacing Values:</h3>
  
  •The replace() method can be used to replace specific values in a DataFrame or Series.

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  
  Handling missing values is a crucial step in data preprocessing. By using the techniques demonstrated in this repository, you can ensure your datasets are clean and 
  ready for analysis or modeling (I had only covered some important function and techniques used in Handling Missing Values in a Datasets).
